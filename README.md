## Inspiration
Our team was named Ruby on Rails because we originally thought of making a web application using Ruby on Rails using train API data ("Rails" would be fitting to the theme of transportation).
We did end up doing something and completely pivoted our project as one of our team members had an interest in making a strategy game, and our team decided to make small individual games for a microgame pack. 

## What it does
### Mobile Arms
Primary Hacker: Devin
Turn-based strategy game

### BreadTravels
Primary Hacker: Stuart
Flappy Bird but St. Louis Bread Co themed

## How we built it
The mini-games were built using Unity and C# scripting.
The tank 3D model was made by Stuart using Blender.
